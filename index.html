				In the photography department, we have a quota of 60 edits per day. In the box labeled "Images Edited Today", place the number of images you've edited today and press the "Calculate" button. You may need to change the "Hours Imager Worked Today" if you have worked over or under the normal work day hours. The Quota Calculator will calculate your score and other helpful information so you can determine how efficient you have been today and what you need to do to reach your quota.
